#  Firebase Auth Demo
This app shows you how to handle authentication with Firebase. It is based on the amazing
iOS Databases course by codewithchris.com. 

## Setting up Authentication
After installing the FirebaseAuth and FirebaseFirstore packages, we can choose, which 
modules to use within the Firebase console for authentication. There are many authentication
providers we can accept, but will choose the email only for now:

We can use Google's pre-built UIs in order to get started even faster: 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/firebaseui?authuser=0.


## Pre-Built UI Views
Thanks to Google, you can implement a great login view within a few minutes. It will automatically interact with
Firebase's Authentication screen to login the user.
